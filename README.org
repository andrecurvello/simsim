* Objectives 
- Simulate code execution of the ATMega163 microcontroller.
- Keep track of current clock cycles.

* Running instructions
- you need a hex-file compiled for an atmega163
- you need an elf-file compiled for an atmega163 to get the symbol table, for better visualization
- start Racket
- open the file
- load hex and elf files
- run 
- for examples, see the test directory

* Support status
- ATMega163: small subset of instructions can be simulated
