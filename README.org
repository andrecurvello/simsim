* Objectives 
- Simulate code execution of the ATMega163 microcontroller
- Print execution trace
- Print processed data for leakage analysis

* Prerequisites
- You need a hex-file compiled for an atmega163
- You need an elf-file compiled for an atmega163 to get the symbol table, for better visualization

* Running the tests
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ cd tests/
$ racket -f all-tests.rkt
#+END_SRC


* Support status
- ATMega163: small subset of instructions can be simulated
