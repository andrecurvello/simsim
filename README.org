* Objectives 
Simulate code execution of some chosen microcontrollers.

* Running instructions
- you need a hex-file compiled for an atmega163
- you need an elf-file compiled for an atmega163 to get the symbol table, for better visualization
- start Racket
- open the file
- load hex and elf files
- run 
- for examples, see the test directory

* Support status
- ATMega163 (small subset of instructions can be simulated)

* TODO Next steps
** TODO Separate fetching and execution
- fetch: analyzes the instruction and extracts its arguments
- execute: takes the arguments and executes the instruction
-> we can look at the code without executing it!
-> the code might look less messy
** TODO Add clock cycles
** TODO Opcode analysis: what is the Hamming weight of each opcode?
** TODO Work out the file-format for saved data
* DONE FINISHED
